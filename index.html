      </p><em>Just starting out as a <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Developer</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>
        This is my personal website, I am using this as test bed to understand and develop my skills as a full stack developer.
        My background started off creatively studying as a graphic designer and photographer, however since starting a sales role I have been successful doing that. Now it’s time for change, change to become a full stack developer.
